## üìÇ **Features Tested**
---
1. **User Authentication:**
   - Verified the **login** and **registration** functionality with valid credentials.
   - Tested **password recovery** to ensure proper functionality for account recovery.

2. **Search Functionality:**
   - Ensured that **search results** match expected results based on queries.
   - Validated search filters like category, price, and brand.

3. **Cart and Wishlist Management:**
   - Validated the ability to **add**, **remove**, and **update** products in both the **cart** and **wishlist**.
   - Verified that the **cart** retains items across user sessions.

4. **Checkout Process:**
   - Fully tested the **checkout workflow**, including applying coupon codes, entering shipping details, and processing payments.
   - Ensured that the **order confirmation page** is correctly displayed after completing the purchase.

5. **UI Testing and Responsiveness:**
   - Verified that the website adjusts and looks correctly on **desktop**, **tablet**, and **mobile** screens.
   - Ensured **UI elements** like buttons, forms, and navigation align properly across devices.

   - The plan outlines the testing approach for both manual and automated tests.

5. **BDD Scenarios:**
   - **Behavior Driven Development (BDD)** scenarios written in Gherkin format. These scenarios help define the application behavior from the user's perspective, ensuring clarity in testing requirements.

6. **Manual Test Cases for Non-Functional Testing:**
   - **Manual test cases** for **non-functional testing** covering performance, security, and usability tests.
   - These cases ensure the application can handle large user loads, is secure, and provides a good user experience.

7. **Bug Report:**
   - A detailed **bug report** listing all issues discovered during testing, including bug IDs, descriptions, severity, steps to reproduce, and status.

8. **Test Summary Report:**
   - A summary of test execution results, including the number of test cases passed, failed, skipped, and details on any major defects found.
   - The report includes high-level recommendations based on the testing outcomes.

9. **Presentation Report:**
   - A **presentation report** summarizing key findings, bug trends, test execution results, and suggestions for improvement. This report is aimed at stakeholders and developers to help them prioritize work.
